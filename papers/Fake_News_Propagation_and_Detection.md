## Fake News Propagation
#### The spread of true and false news online

</details>
<details>
<summary>summary</summary>
- "Fake news involves more users and forms a deeper cascade of spread from one user to another than real news." Also provides other insights from statistical analysis of propagation graphs. Must read.
</details>  


#### Fake news propagates differently from real news even at early stages of spreading

</details>
<details>
<summary>summary</summary>
- Suggests "suggests a tendency for users to connect with each other and not directly with the news source in the early stages of fake news dissemination." Also provides other insights from statistical analysis of propagation graphs. Must read for developers of early detection models.

## Rumor Propagation
#### Rumor propagation is amplified by echo chambers in social media

</details>
<details>
<summary>summary</summary>
- Explore the relationship between rumor propagation and echo chambers through propagation graph analysis. "The rumor cascades with echo chamber members tend to be larger, deeper, and wider than those without echo chamber members."
